# SequenceExtraction
Execute "./build" and "./run"

You can remove "print" option from "run" file for speed and memory expenses optimization
(In this case process won't even store whole file in RAM, only 2 local chains at each moment)

Possible optimizations: insert memoization for isPrime function
